# SOLID

| SOLID — Acronym for 5 principles: 

- **S**ingle Responsibility
- **O**pen-Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation 
- **D**ependency Inversion

## Single Responsibility

| 1 entity — 1 task

| **God object** — antipattern

| Data **model separated from the behavior**. This principle appears **from incapsulation**

## Open Closed Principle

| **Entity can't be changed** but **can be extended** by other entities

| This principle appears **from inheritance**

## Liskov Substitution Principle

| The parent class should be **replaceable by child class** without correctness changing

| This principle appears **from inheritance and polymorphism** 

## Interface Segregation

| Entities **shouldn't depend** on methods they **don't use**

| This principle appears **from incapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism**

## Dependency Inversion

| High level **entities shouldn't depend on low level entities**. All entities should depend on abstractions and **abstractions shouldn't depend on details**.

| This principle appears from **polymorphism and inheritance**
